| Lv | Project Name  |  Stack  |  Summary  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---|
|0| **[Libft](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/Libft)** | `C` `library` | **Your very first own library** </br> <sub> This project is your very first project as a student at 42. You will need to recode a few functions of the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that you will use during your whole cursus. </br> This project is about coding a C library. It will contain a lot of general purpose functions your programs will rely upon. </sub>|
|1| **[get_next_line](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/get_next_line)** | `C` `getline` | **Reading a line from a fd is way too tedious** </br> <sub> This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor. </br> May it be a file, stdin, or even later a network connection, you will always need a way to read content line by line. It is time to start working on this function, which will be essential for your future projects. </sub> |
|| **netwhat** | `Network` | <sub> This project is an introduction to network problematics. </sub> |
|| **[ft_printf](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/ft_printf)** | `C` `printf` | **Because ft_putnbr() and ft_putstr() aren’t enough** </br> <sub> The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :) </br> You will learn what is and how to implement variadic functions. Once you validate it, you will reuse this function in your future projects. </sub> |
|| **Born2beroot** | `VM` | <sub> This project aims to introduce you to the wonderful world of virtualization. </sub> |
|2| **[minitalk](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/minitalk)** | `C` `UNIX signals` | <sub> The purpose of this project is to code a small data exchange program using UNIX signals. </br> It is an introductory project for the bigger UNIX projects that will appear later on in the cursus. </sub> |
|| **[push_swap](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/push_swap)** | `C` `Algorithm` | **Because Swap_push isn’t as natural** </br> <sub> This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting. </sub> |
|| **[FdF](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/FdF)** | `C` `Graphic` | <sub> This project is about creating a simplified 3D graphic representation of a relief landscape. </br> FdF offers to represent “iron wire” meshing in 3D. </sub> |
|3| **[Philosophers](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/Philosophers)** | `C` `Scheduling` | **I never thought philosophy would be so deadly** </br> <sub> Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. </br> This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger. </br> In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes. </sub> |
|| **[minishell](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/minishell)** | `C` `Shell (bash)` | **As beautiful as a shell** </br> <sub> The objective of this project is for you to create a simple shell. </br> Yes, your little bash or zsh. You will learn a lot about processes and file descriptors. </sub> |
|4| **NetPractice** | `Network` | <sub> NetPractice is a general practical exercise to let you discover networking. </sub> |
|| **[cub3d](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/cub3d)** | `C` `Graphic` `Ray-Casting` | **My first RayCaster with miniLibX** </br> <sub> This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. </br> Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 00](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-00)** | `C++` | <sub> This first module of C++ is designed to help you understand the specifities of the language when compared to C. Time to dive into Object Oriented Programming! </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 01](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-01)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand the memory allocation, reference, pointers to members and the usage of the switch in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 02](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-02)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand Ad-hoc polymorphism, overloads and orthodox canonical classes in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 03](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-03)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand Inheritance in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 04](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-04)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes and interfaces in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 05](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-05)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand Try/Catch and Exceptions in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 06](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-06)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand the different casts in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 07](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-07)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand Templates in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 08](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-08)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP. </sub> |
|| **[CPP Module 09](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/CPP-Module/tree/main/CPP-Module-09)** | `C++` | <sub> This module is designed to help you understand the containers in CPP. </sub> |
|5| **[Inception](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/Inception)** | `Docker` `LAMP Stack` | <sub> This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. </br> You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine. </br> docker, docker compose, nginx, mysql, redis, ftp, adminer, code-server </sub> |
|| **[webserv](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/webserv)** | `C++` `HTTP Server` | **This is when you finally understand why a URL starts with HTTP** </br> <sub> This project is about writing your own HTTP server. You will be able to test it with an actual browser. </br> HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you won’t be working on a website. </sub> |
|| **[ft_containers](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/ft_containers)** | `C++` `STL` `TMP` | **C++ containers, easy mode** </br> <sub> The standard C++ containers have all a specific usage. </br> To make sure you understand them, let’s re-implement them! </sub> |
|6| **[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/ecole42-yoma/ft_transcendence)** | `TypeScript` `Nest.JS` `PostgreSQL` `React` `Jotai` | **Soon, you will realize that you already know things that you thought you didn’t** </br> <sub> No more C! No more C++! This project is about doing something you’ve never done before. </br> Remind yourself the beginning of your journey in computer science. Look at you now. Time to shine! </sub>|  |
